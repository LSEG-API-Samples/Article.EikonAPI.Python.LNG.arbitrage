# Geographical Arbitrage for Liquified Natural Gas (LNG) Exports from the US
In the LNG market, arbitrage can be defined as a strategy of diverting a physical cargo from one market to another which offers a higher price. Price differentials can occur between regional markets due to different pricing structures and imbalances between supply and demand which allows traders to exploit and capitalize on. In this example, we look at the key variable costs to determine if the arbitrage window to Asia is open or if it is more profitable to ship a cargo from the United States to Asia than to Europe
